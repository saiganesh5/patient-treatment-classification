# patient-treatment-classification

### The Patient Treatment Classification project is a machine learning-based solution aimed at predicting the appropriate treatment type for patients based on their medical profiles. The dataset used includes features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and BMI. The project involved thorough data preprocessing, including cleaning, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and scaling features. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand data distribution and feature relationships. Multiple classification algorithms were implemented, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, and MLP Classifier. A Stacking Classifier was also built to combine the strengths of these individual models. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The project effectively demonstrated how machine learning can support clinical decision-making by accurately classifying treatment types, using Python and libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and seaborn.
